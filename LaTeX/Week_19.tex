    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item A key can allow the sender to encrypt and receiver to decrypt coded message
        \item The transfer of key is the most vulnerable point of creating a secure channel, QDK utilize quantum mechanics to alert the sender and receiver if the key has been intercepted during transparent with probability
        \item Bob and Alice will have different result when comparing the first few bits of their key and will know that Eve intercepted them
        \item True : the qubit is what Bob will measure
        \item False : once they have a key, they can use encryption to keep teir message safe
